# Overview
   This is my second challenge in front end mentor, which is to create a result summary component using HTML and CSS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
    I have used HTML and CSS only to build this component.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
   This project was a milestone in my front end journey. I was earlier comfortable with the knowledge I had of CSS. But in this project, some things didnt work out as I had expected. So it pushed me to refer more content and learn more. After completing it, I came to know that starting with the mobile design and later onto the desktop design is the best way for responsiveness. Since I did the opposite, it consumed more time. And even now my responsiveness is not upto the mark. But Im proud of myself for pushing me out of the comfort zone and exploring more.
### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Media_queries) - This helped me for responsive design. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
